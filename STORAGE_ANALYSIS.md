| **Hourly aggregates** | 657 MB | 657 MB | Pre-computed |
| **Daily aggregates** | 27 MB | 27 MB | Pre-computed |
| **Indexes & metadata** | ~500 MB | ~100 MB | 80% compression |
| **Total estimated** | 32.6 GB | **3.8 GB** | **88% savings** |

### Reading Volume Analysis

```
Total readings over 5 years: 157,680,000
├── Per year: 31,536,000
├── Per month: 2,628,000
├── Per day: 86,400
└── Per sensor per day: 8,640
```

### Storage Growth Timeline

| Year | Raw Data (GB) | Compressed (GB) | Cumulative (GB) |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | 6.3 | 0.63 | 0.76 |
| Year 2 | 6.3 | 0.63 | 1.52 |
| Year 3 | 6.3 | 0.63 | 2.28 |
| Year 4 | 6.3 | 0.63 | 3.04 |
| Year 5 | 6.3 | 0.63 | **3.80** |

## Alternative Scenarios

### Conservative: 3-Year Retention
- **Total storage**: 2.3 GB
- **Yearly growth**: 0.76 GB
- **Suitable for**: Limited storage environments

### Aggressive: 20 Sensors, 5-Second Intervals
- **Total storage**: 15.2 GB over 5 years
- **Still very manageable** for most systems

### High-Frequency: 10 Sensors, 1-Second Intervals
- **Total storage**: 38 GB over 5 years
- **Requires more planning** but still feasible

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Query Performance by Data Age

| Data Age | Query Type | Expected Response Time |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **< 7 days** | Raw data queries | < 100ms |
| **< 1 month** | Raw data queries | < 500ms |
| **< 1 year** | Aggregated queries | < 50ms |
| **1-5 years** | Aggregated queries | < 200ms |

### Storage I/O Characteristics

- **Write volume**: ~100 KB/second (all sensors)
- **Compression ratio**: 10:1 after 7 days
- **Index overhead**: ~15% of compressed data
- **Vacuum overhead**: ~5% during maintenance

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Storage Costs (Estimated)

| Storage Type | 5-Year Cost | Annual Cost |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Local SSD** (4GB) | $20 | $4 |
| **Cloud storage** (4GB) | $24 | $4.80 |
| **Enterprise SAN** (4GB) | $40 | $8 |

### Value Retention

| Retention Period | Historical Analysis | Trend Detection | Seasonal Patterns |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **3 months** | Limited | Basic | None |
| **1 year** | Good | Good | Basic |
| **3 years** | Excellent | Excellent | Good |
| **5 years** | **Outstanding** | **Outstanding** | **Excellent** |

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Database Size Monitoring

```sql
-- Check current storage usage
SELECT * FROM storage_monitoring;

-- Monitor growth rate
SELECT * FROM get_growth_statistics(30);

-- Estimate future requirements
SELECT * FROM estimate_storage_requirements(10, 10, 5);
```

### Automated Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Compression** | Weekly | Reduce storage by 90% |
| **Vacuum** | Daily | Reclaim deleted space |
| **Statistics** | Daily | Optimize query plans |
| **Backup** | Daily | Data protection |

### Alert Thresholds

- **Storage usage > 80%**: Warning
- **Growth rate > 150% expected**: Investigation needed
- **Compression ratio < 5:1**: Check compression health
- **Query response > 1s**: Performance review

## Recommendations

### ✅ Recommended: 5-Year Retention

**Reasons:**
1. **Minimal storage impact**: 3.8 GB is negligible on modern systems
2. **High analytical value**: Long-term trends and seasonal patterns
3. **Low cost**: Storage costs are minimal compared to sensor hardware
4. **Future-proof**: Accommodates additional sensors without concern

### Hardware Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | Future-Proof |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Storage** | 10 GB | 20 GB | 50 GB |
| **RAM** | 2 GB | 4 GB | 8 GB |
| **CPU** | 2 cores | 4 cores | 4 cores |

### Scaling Considerations

- **Up to 25 sensors**: No architectural changes needed
- **Up to 100 sensors**: Consider partitioning by sensor groups
- **Beyond 100 sensors**: Multi-node TimescaleDB cluster

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors ✅
- Storage growth is predictable and linear
- TimescaleDB compression is highly effective
- Standard PostgreSQL tooling available

### Medium Risk Factors ⚠️
- Query performance may degrade without proper indexing
- Backup time increases with data volume
- Network overhead for cloud deployments

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular index maintenance and optimization
- Incremental backup strategies
- Local deployment for bandwidth-sensitive environments

## Conclusion

**5-year retention is strongly recommended** for this Ruuvi sensor deployment. The storage requirements are minimal (3.8 GB), costs are negligible, and the analytical value is significant. The TimescaleDB solution provides excellent compression and performance characteristics that make long-term retention both practical and valuable.

The system can comfortably handle 2-3x growth in sensor count or data frequency without requiring architectural changes, making this a robust long-term solution.
